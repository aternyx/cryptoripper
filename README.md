  Ever saw some sort of "magical crypto miner" videos all over Instagram or any other social media platform? 
  You wish you had that software but cannot pay a price of 500$? 
  Why not use this ~~Python script~~ Rust software.

## WARNING / DISCLAIMER
  This program is made for educational purposes. It is only 
  made to demonstrate the glorious security of cryptocurrency. 
  Using this to steal may lead to possible (severe) consequences. 
  This should be used for attempts to recover your own wallet that
  you have lost. I will not be responding to any help related to 
  this script that I recieve on my DMs. Bailing out, you are on
  your own. Thanks for paying attention.

# Usage
  Navigate the software as you would usually do in Vim.
