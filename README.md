# cryptoripper
  Ever saw some sort of "magical crypto miner" videos all over Instagram? 
  You wish you had that software but cannot pay a price of 500$? 
  Why not use this Python script.

## WARNING / DISCLAIMER
  This program is made for educational purposes. It is only 
  made to demonstrate the security of wallets with 12 word
  mnemonic (known as seedphrase). Usage of this to steal
  may lead to possible consequences. Thank you for reading. 

The script is incredibly slow in checking the balance of  
the wallet. Planning to fix soon.
